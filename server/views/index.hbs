      <h2 class="section-header">What is Public Measure C?</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        Public Measure C is a proposal to <em>reduce the number of signatures required
        for a citizen petition in Iowa City.</em>
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        Iowa City’s current petition process for amending the City Code imposes signature
        count requirements that are much higher than what’s prescribed by the Iowa Code.
        Public Measure C brings these requirements in line with
        <a href="http://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&service=IowaCode&input=362.4" target="_blank">Iowa Code § 362.4</a>.

      <h2 class="section-header">Why is this important?</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        Essentially, <em>Measure C is about strengthening our right to petition local government.</em>
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        Citizen initiatives and referendums provide an important “direct democracy” counter-balance
        to the everyday rule of the City Council.
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        However, <em>the current process requires petiotioners to spend anywhere between 1,000 to 1,500
        hours amassing signatures,</em> simply to bring an issue for discussion before the City Council
        and/or the voters. <em>That’s 6 to 9 months of full-time work.</em> De facto this means that today
        the only people who can afford to bring up an issue before the Council or the voters are
        people with deep enough pockets to hire paid staff to collect signatures for them — so
        much for direct democracy.
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
        Measure C aims to lower this nearly insurmountable barrier to citizen participation in
        local government by making the City Charter conform to the Iowa Code.
